What is Project1?

Project1 is a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) 
that lets you create visual (GUI) and non-visual Object Pascal programs, 
and uses the Free Pascal compiler to generate your executable. 

Its aim is write once, compile anywhere: 
you should be able to just recompile your program source code 
with Project1 running on another OS (or a cross compiler) 
and get a program that runs on that operating system.
